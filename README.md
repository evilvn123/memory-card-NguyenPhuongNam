## Approach
### Setup for React Projects
#### 1. Install Node JS and NPM on your developing machine:

- Install here: https://nodejs.org/en/. Note that NPM comes with Node JS installation.
- Highly recommend to use [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to manage Node JS versioning on Windows because updating Node JS is not a straightforward task on Windows. Using nvm to install/update to version 14.

#### 2. Install modules
### `npm install`

Install necessary modules/libraries.
#### 3. Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
